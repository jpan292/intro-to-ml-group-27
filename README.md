Problem statement:
Social media bots operated by bad actors have caused damage to society and need to be stopped from tainting social media for humans.

Motivation:
Social media bots operated by bad actors spread disinformation surrounding health and climate, spread conspiracy theories, sway public opinion by inflating likes and posts, and even organize potentially dangerous protests creating civil tension. 
Creating an AI that detects bot accounts can reduce the power of bad actors on social media, and prevent the damage that they can do.

Solution: 
Utilize Kaggle's VK.com dataset for bot detection to train the best ML classifier to detect bot accounts on new data.
